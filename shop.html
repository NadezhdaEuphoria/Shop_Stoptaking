Create a function that receives the array of goods and returns the cost that should be paid for all these goods.
Your code should: </p>
<p>- Validate the data according to the following rules: item: string,  type: string, weight: number, quantity: 
     number, pricePerKilo: `“$” + number` - string,  pricePerItem: `“$” + number` - string </p>
    <p>- Print to the console the total quantity of all watermelons (`Watermelons - ${quantity}`); </p>
        <p>- Print to the console the total weight of all apples (`Apples - ${weight}`); </p>
            <p>- Sort the array in alphabetical order by item field and print it to the console; </p>
                <p>- Sort the array by cost of the record and print it to the console; </p>
                    <p>- Print to the terminal the type of oranges with the least price (`The cheapest orange type is: ${type}`);
                        <p>- Print to the console the cost of the goods by item name (`Apples - ${costApples}, Pineapples 
                            - ${costPineapples}, Watermelons - ${costWatermelons}, Oranges - ${costOranges}`); </p>
                            <p>- Print to the console the result of the execution of this function. </p>


          
 <p> Note: Try to minimize your code. </p>
